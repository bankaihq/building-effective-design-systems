						# Building effective
						# design systems

						using Vue, React or whatever...
					</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Hi, my name is __Sanne Peters__

					and I work at __BANKAI__

					as a __Front-end Software Architect__
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
				We are a tiny Design Agency

				that mostly works by __collaborating__

				with others
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					And we collaborate a lot

					Notes:
					- governments
					- scientific institutes
					- data-management
					- hardware manufactures
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					And we love Design Systems ❤️

					because they
				
					are __collaboration__ and __communication__ tools.

					Notes:
					In order to understands why this is important
					we need to know the users
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Who uses Design Systems?
					- Designers
					- Developers
					- Product Owners
					- Copy Writers
					- Data Scientists
					- Marketeers

					Notes:
					- Designers (documenting design choices, toolbox) 
					- Developers (toolbox, ref. for how to use thing)
					- Product Owners (Getting a sense of how time is invested)
					- Copy Writers (providing context for UI texts)
					- Data Scientists (how to map data into components)
					- Marketeers (docs about brand identity)

					Single Source of thruth for an organisation.
					onboarding new people

				<section data-markdown>
					## How to build something that can be used by everyone?

					Key parts:
					1. Work __together__
					2. Keep __structure__
					3. Grow __safely__

					Notes:
					1. Work __together__; through __co-ownership__
					2. Keep structure; making it __accessible__ and __maintainable__
					3. grow __safely__.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Part 1: Work together

					In order for it to be effective the system needs to be 
					owned __together__. The best way to achieve this is to work on it __together__.

					Notes:
					Solves designer vs developer problem.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Establish a common language
					
					In order to understand each other you need to speak the same language
					
					Everyone uses different terms for the same things
				</section>
				<section
					data-markdown
					data-background-image="/images/mysterious-apple-peripheral.jpeg"
				>
					Notes:
					what is this called?
					Usb-c one to many connector
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Establish a common language
					__The whole team__ should use __the same terms__
					
					Notes: everyone comes in from different backgrounds and therefore has different perspectives
					Cooperation is not a 1 way street, it needs to come from both directions
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Involve each other in the decision making:
					- How do __we__ name this thing?
					- Does its structure make sense?
					- How should it work?
					- Do __we__ need this feature documented?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Sharing is caring

					Notes: By sharing you learn about each other and each other skills
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Share what you know about the web. So Designers can make more informed decisions
					- both on what's possible and what's not.
					- propose to research something.
					- Prototype something...
					- talk about obscure/new web technologies

					Notes:
					webtech: like Variable Fonts or Web Audio API
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					**Don't force people** to do
					what they **do not want** too.

					Be nice, be forgiving.

					Notes:
					Find the right way for collaboration for your team. 
					Remember that this is always different for each member.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Part 2: Keep structure
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Allow yourself to think less and create room for some...
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="/images/creativity-duck-bananas.jpg">
					### ✨ creativity ✨
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Define a structure for the system
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## The most basic values

					We use __Design Tokens__
					to define the most __basic values__
					
					Design Tokens were defined by SalesForce as part of their
					lightning design system
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Organise components in a hierarchy.

					- A hierarchy creates structure 
					- Adds context to each component.
					
					Notes:
					needs rules,
					without rules there is chaos.

						Notes: I've seen many people change them so lots of reasons.
						Don't. That way you're effectively creating a new way of working.
						If you keep it as it is it is easier to explain it.

					### Composing components, not building them

					Notes:
					You are not a mindless machine.
					Or at least,
					you shouldn't be.
					Thinking is like, good.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Making components is a __creative process__.

					Yes, you're an artist now. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					Notes:
					> So next time when your parents ask you "so, what do you do again?"
					> You say, "I am an artist, a digital artist"
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Composing components is done through __collaboration__

					- Discuss the design with the person who made it.
					- Does it contain all the info you need?
					- Ask question on how it should work?
					- Are animations and transitions defined. If not, should they?

					Notes:
					Have a discussion about, using clear arguments and explain them.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="/images/lion-king-rafiki-naming-simba.jpg">
					# name your component
				</section>
				<section data-markdown="">
						"But naming things is hard 😨."
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Some tricks:
						- Define the name rather by __what they do__ than by __how they look__
						- Use simple, every day words. (remember you work in a multi-disciplinary team)
						- Iterate on the name, just modify it as you compose it.
						- Ask a co-worker!

						style: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) & [WC3](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name)

						Notes: - Accordeon --> expandable-list-layout
						- Toast --> popup-notification
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						## Part 3: Grow __safely__
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						### Each thing should be documented
						
						The bigger a team gets the harder it is to communicate.
						Document once and you will never need to explain it again.
						
						Documentation tools: styleguidist ([React](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) or [Vue](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/)) and [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

						Notes:
						- design tokens
						- components
						- utilities
						
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Each functionality needs to be covered by tests

						- Start with manual testing scripts
						- translate those to code-based test
						- automate your tests (pre-commit or pre-merge hooks)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Don't re-invent the wheel.

					Use methods that are well thought out and established,
					like:
					
					- for structured version control: [__git flow__](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [__github flow__](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
					- add linting (like, eslint standard or AirBNB).
					- do __code reviews__ through __Pull/Merge Request__
					- set up integration testing and end-to-end testing
					- automate the hell out of it! 
					
					Notes:
					- for structured version control: [__git flow__](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [__github flow__](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
					- add linting (like, eslint standard or AirBNB). Stop wasting time having tabs-vs-spaces discussions or wether or not something needs an extra comma behind it.
					- do __code reviews__ through __Pull/Merge Request__
					- set up integration testing and end-to-end testing
					- automate the hell out of it! 

					Make it your mantra.
					(maybe later, tweak it to fit your needs.)

						- Communicate, start talking in easy terms and be nice to people.
						- Don't re-invent the wheel

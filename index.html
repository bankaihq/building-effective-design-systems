				<section data-markdown>
					Hi, my name is __Sanne Peters__

					and I work at BANKAI

					as a Front-end Software Architect
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					‚ù§Ô∏è And I love Design Systems ‚ù§Ô∏è

					Design Systems are one of our main tools for collaboration
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					And we collaborate a lot

					- governments
					- scientific institutes
					- big data companies
					- API developers
					- freelancers
					- tech companies
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Who uses Design Systems anyway?
					- Designers
					- Developers
					- Copy Writers
					- Data Scientists
					- Product Owners
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## So how do you build something that can be used by everyone?
					- Working together, through __co-ownership__
					- making it __accessible__ and __maintainable__
					- Allow it to grow __safely__.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Working together

					In order for it to be effective the system needs to be owned together. The best way to achieve this is to work on it together.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Establishing a common language

					Everyone uses different terms for the same things
					The whole team should use the same words for the same things
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Involve each other in the decision making:
					- How do we name this component?
					- Does this structure make sense?
					- How should it work?
					- Do you need this feature documented?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Share what you know about the web. So Designers can make more informed decisions
					- both what's possible and what's not.
					- propose to research something.
					- talk about unknown web technologies (like Variable Fonts or Web Audio API)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					**Don't force people** to do
					what they **do not want** too.

					Be forgiving
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Step 2: ~making~ __keeping__ it accessible and maintainable
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Don't re-invent the wheel.

					Make it your mantra.
					
					Use methods that are well thought out and established,
					like:
					
					- for structured version control: [__git flow__](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [__github flow__](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
					- add linting (like, eslint standard or AirBNB). Stop wasting time having tabs-vs-spaces discussions or wether or not something needs an extra comma behind it.
					- do __code reviews__ through __Pull/Merge Request__
					- set up integration testing and end-to-end testing
					- automate as much as possible, allow yourself to think less and create room for some
						‚ú® creativity ‚ú®
					
					(maybe later, tweak it to fit your needs.)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Define a structure for the system
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Design Tokens

					We use __Design Tokens__
					to define the most __basic values__
					
					Design Tokens were defined by SalesForce as part of their
					lightning design system
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## organise components in a heirarchy.

					A hierarchy creates structure and adds a high level meaning to each component.
					needs rules,
					without rules there is chaos.
					[funny background pic]
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Take for example Atomic Design

					App                 Village
					Views (pages)       Neighbourhood
					layout (templates)  Street-plan
					Organisms           House
					Molecules           Wall
					Atoms               Brick
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Composing components, not building them

					You are not a mindless machine.
					Or at least,
					you shouldn't be.
					
					Thinking is like, good.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Making components is a __creative process__.

					> _yes, you're an artist now_

					> So next time when your parents ask you "so, what do you do again?"
					> You say, "I am an artist, a digital artist"
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Composing components is done through __co-creation__

					- Discuss the design with the person who made it.
					- Does it contain all the info you need?
					- Ask question on how it should work?
					- Are animations and transitions defined. If not, should they?

					Have a discussion about, using clear arguments and explain them.

					# name your child

					> But naming things is hard üò®.

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Some tricks:
						- Define the name rather by __what they do__ than by __how they look__
						- Use simple, every day words. (remember you work in a multi-disciplinary team)
							- Accordeon --> expandable-list-layout
							- Toast --> popup-notification
						- Iterate on the name, just modify it as you compose it.
						- Ask a co-worker!

						style: https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/ & https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						### Allow it to grow __safely__.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Each thing should be documented
						- design tokens
						- components
						- utilities
						
						The bigger a team gets the harder it is to communicate.
						Document once and you will never need to explain it again.
						
						Documentation tools: styleguidist ([React](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) or [Vue](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/)) and [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						Each functionality needs to be covered by tests

						Start with manual testing scripts
						translate those to code-based test
						automate your tests (pre-commit or pre-merge hooks)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						## So summarised:

						- Communicate, start talking in easy terms and be nice to people.
						- Don't re-invent the wheel
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						# A few final words

						Leave/create room for creativity
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						Ask me anything

					Design Systems ‚ù§Ô∏è

					are __collaboration__ and __communication__ tools.

					Notes:
					In order to understands why this is important
					we need to know the users
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Who uses Design Systems?
					- Designers
					- Developers
					- Product Owners
					- Copy Writers
					- Data Scientists
					- Marketeers

					Notes:
					- Designers (documenting design choices, toolbox) 
					- Developers (toolbox, ref. for how to use thing)
					- Product Owners (Getting a sense of how time is invested)
					- Copy Writers (providing context for UI texts)
					- Data Scientists (how to map data into components)
					- Marketeers (docs about brand identity)

					Single Source of thruth for an organisation.
					onboarding new people

					## How to build something that can be used by everyone?

					Key parts:
					1. Work __together__
					2. Keep __structure__
					3. Scale __safely__

					Notes:
					1. Work __together__; through __co-ownership__
					2. Keep structure; making it __accessible__ and __maintainable__
					3. Scale __safely__.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Part 1: Work together

					In order for it to be effective the system needs to be 
					owned __together__. The best way to achieve this is to work on it __together__.

					Notes:
					Solves designer vs developer problem.
					This is the only way it will be become a single source of truth.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### A common language
					
					Everyone uses __different terms__ for the __same things__. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					
					In order to understand __each other__ you need to speak the __same language__. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					
				</section>
				<section
					data-markdown

				>
					Notes:
					what is this called?

					Write it down on a piece of paper.

					Usb-c one to many connector
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### A common language
					__The whole team__ should use __the same terms__
					
					Notes: everyone comes in from different backgrounds and therefore has different perspectives
					Cooperation is not a 1 way street, it needs to come from both directions
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### A common language
				
					Involve each other in the decision making:
					- How do __we__ name this thing?
					- Does its structure make sense?
					- How should it work?
					- Do __we__ need this feature documented?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Part 2: Structure

				<section data-markdown>
					## Structure: the most basic values

					We use __Foundation Tokens__
					to define the most __basic values__ of the design's __inherit__ logic.

					- __Colours__, and how they are, used.
					- __Typography__, headings labels, etc.
					- __Sizings__, spaces between, and sizes of components
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Pallette colours:
					```scss
					$colour-primary: #E64D1F; // soft-red
					$colour-primary-high-contrast: #A41111; // dark-red

					$colour-secondary: #036F7B; // grey-blue
					$colour-secondary-high-contrast: #174A5B; // dark-grey-blue
					```

					Pallette colours applied to base values:
					```scss
					// For headings and labels:
					$colour-main-item: $colour-primary;
					$colour-main-item-border: $colour-primary-high-contrast;

					// For Call to Action items, like buttons.
					$colour-cta: $colour-primary;
					$colour-cta-border: $colour-primary-high-contrast;

					// For active elements, like buttons, but that need to
					// draw less attention, like table options.
					$colour-support: $colour-secondary;
					$colour-support-border: $colour-secondary-high-contrast;
					```

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Structure: organising components

					- A hierarchy creates structure
					- Adds context to each component.
					
					Notes:
					needs rules,
					without rules there is chaos.

					<h2>Structure: hierarchy</h2>
					<p>(An example)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							App <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6">
								(<strong>Village</strong>)
							</span>
						</li>
						<li>

					### Composing components, not building them

					Notes:
					I call it composing component, because its a process.
					We are not a mindless machines.
					Or at least,
					you shouldn't be.
					Thinking is like, good.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Making components is a __creative process__.

					Yes, you're an artist now. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

					Notes:
					> So next time when your parents ask you "so, what do you do again?"
					> You say, "I am an artist, a digital artist"
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Composing components is done through __collaboration__

					- Discuss the design with the person who made it.
					- Does it contain all the info we need?
					- We ask critical questions on how it should work.
					- Are animations and transitions defined. If not, should they?

					Notes:
					Have a discussion about, using clear arguments and explain them.

					## name your component

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## name your component
				
					Some tricks:
					- Define the name rather by __what they do__ than by __how they look__
					- Use simple, every day words. (remember you work in a multi-disciplinary team)
					- Iterate on the name, just modify it as you compose it.
					- Ask a co-worker!

					Notes:
					- Accordeon --> expandable-list-layout
					- Toast --> popup-notification

						## Part 3: Scale __safely__

						Notes:
						This part is all about quality, what methods should you use?
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						### Scale safely: Each thing is documented
						
						The bigger a team gets the harder it is to communicate.
						Document once and you will never need to explain it again.

						Documentation tools:

						- __StyleGuidist__ ([React](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) or [Vue](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io/)) ‚ù§Ô∏è
						- [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/) works for Vue, React, Svelte and others.

						[An example](http://localhost:6060/#/Organisms/DetailedInfoHeader).

						Notes:
						- Foundation Tokens
						- components
						- utilities
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
						### Each functionality needs to have tests

						- Start with manual testing scripts
						- Translate those to code-based test
						- Automate your tests
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Don't re-invent the wheel.

					Use methods that are well thought out and established,
					like:

					- Structured version control (GIT + [__git flow__](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/))
					- Linting (predefined rules, like, eslint standard or AirBNB)
					- __Code reviews__ through __Pull/Merge Request__
					- Integration and end-to-end testing (We use cypress, for everything)
					- All automated through CI/CD and git hooks

					Notes:
					- for structured version control: [__git flow__](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) or [__github flow__](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
					- add linting (like, eslint standard or AirBNB). Stop wasting time having tabs-vs-spaces discussions or wether or not something needs an extra comma behind it.
					- do __code reviews__ through __Pull/Merge Request__
					- set up integration testing and end-to-end testing
					- automate the hell out of it!

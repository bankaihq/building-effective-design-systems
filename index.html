						# Naming things

						by Sanne Peters
						</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Hi,

					my name is __Sanne Peters__

					I am a __front-end architect__ at __BANKAI__
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					In my work I deal with:
	
					- Design Systems
					- UI components
					- The semantic web
					- Data visualisation
					- Design Op(eration)s
	
					which all involve **naming things**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					1. Why I care and you should too.
					2. Some theory
					3. Practical tips!

					Notes:
					In this talk I want to discuss the following things...
					But I wanna start with this quote.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					> There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.
					>
					> â€” Phil Karlton

					Notes:
					I bet most of us have heard of this saying. And I like it,
					because points out how deceptively tricky this subject is.

					And since I have no clue how to invalidate cache,
					I thought, let's pick the other hardest thing!
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Why I care and you should too.

					Notes:
					I have Autism, which means I have difficulty understanding 
					something that is implied or hinted at. but I also makes me acutely 
					aware of these problems and that they might affect others too.

					This is why in communication I appreciate clarity and 
					honesty above all else, because that way I will always 
					understand what the other means.

					This is why I care so much about naming things. 

					The reason you should is that using the right names 
					for something makes communication clearer and easier to understand.
					And that makes it accessible, for everyone, despite their 'disabilities'.
					
					So when you put just that little bit of extra effort into properly naming something, 
					your not just showing you care about the quality of the code, 
					but that you also care the efficiency of everyone else in your team.

					# Theory
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why is naming things hard?</h2>

					<p class="fragment">
						When we build things the focus is on getting things done.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment">
					People are also lazy.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						Proper names and documentation tend to get a backseat.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment">
						so you need to <strong>think ahead</strong>. <br>
						And that is <strong>hard</strong>.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When we build things the focus is on getting things done.</P>

						People are also lazy.
						that way they will focus the most important things, 
						<p>because they need be done.</P>

						But thinking like that, means that things like
						proper names and documentation tend to get a backseat.
						<p>And frankly this is short term thinking.</P>

						Because the names you come up with still need to make sense
						5 months from now.
						<p>So you need to think ahead. And that is hard. </P>

						<p>The reason why this is hard,
						is that the meaning of a name needs to be remain the same
						even through time. And this is where the field of semantics can help.
						<p>

					### Semantics,
					or the philosophy of meaning
					
					Semantics talks about how things do not exist on their own, but always in a context.

					Notes: 
					Semantics talks about how things do not exist on their own, but always in a context.

					This context is like a domain. Like a nation's culture, or a certain industry.
					Each one of those domain have specific names for things that only have meaning within those domains.
					Those 'sets' of names are also called a shared language.

					The main benefit of a shared language is that you have a common understanding
					of what you mean and the other receives.
					</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Shared language

					Or in other words:
					Names allow us to discuss a subject without it being present.

					Notes:
					Names allow us to discuss a subject without it being present. 
					Like if you want to talk about John from accounting an how he is is really into bonsai. 
					Try doing this without the use of names AND examples!

				It is good to give it a name that makes sense to everyone
				on the team and maybe even in the organisation. This is what shared language is.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Shared language

					This is also true when we are building systems.

					Notes:
					This is also true when we are building systems.
					Those systems will inherently contain new components,
					those need meaningful names. So they can be easily talked about in communication. 

					Using the shared language of your team you more easily create names that makes sense to everyone in the team.

					<h2> Defining names</h2>

					<p class="fragment">
						Take for instance me. my name is Sanne, 
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						which is a terrible way to identify or describe me. Better ones would be:
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						software-architect-at-bankai (In a work context)
					</p>
					<p class="fragment">
						the-tall-know-it-all (In a family context)
					</p>
				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
					## Defining names

					Variables

					consider:
					```css
					$primary-colour: #ff0000; /* this is red */
					```
					versus:

					```css
					$cta-colour: #ff0000; /* this is also red */
					```
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Defining names

					For UI components

					![Three USP examples](/images/three-usp-component-examples.svg)

					Notes:
					- usp-block (NO)
					- usp-summary (YES)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Defining names

					For Functions

					```js
					function sortNames (names) {
						// in JS array sorting is done in place
						// so copy them to a new array first
						const sortedNames = names.map(name => name)
						sortedNames.sort()
						return sortedNames
					}
					```

					```js
					function sortAlphabetically (strings) {
						// in JS array sorting is done in place
						// so copy them to a new array first
						const sortedStrings = strings.map(string => string)
						sortedStrings.sort()
						return sortedStrings
					}
					```

					# Practical Tips

					- Reason from another's perspective, not your own.
					- Avoid colloquialisms (Typically local ways of saying things)
					- Use simple words
					- Stay away from abbreviations.
					- Make a name longer vs shorter.

					Notes:
					- Reason from another's perspective, not your own.
					- Avoid colloquialisms
					(Typically local ways of saying things). For example, native English speaker's vocabulary is naturally al lot bigger than non-native ones. So they might know that one specific term for something, but those might very well be completely unknown to others.
					- Use simple words,
					- Stay away from abbreviations.
					They make perfect sense to you, but need to be learned. Especially abbreviations that are not part of common language like 'idx', and 'EOB'.
					- Make a name longer vs shorter.
					Longer names, although verbose, tend to be more descriptive.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Naming things is a creative effort,
					so find some inspiration.

					- In a **thesaurus** (like [thesaurus.com/](https://www.thesaurus.com/))
					- In the field of **semantics** (like [schema.org](http://schema.org))
					- Ask a co-worker or a friend. And brainstorm a little. Two minds are more than one.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Iterate on a name.

					Notes:
					(nice little diagram on why iteration in creative process is useful)
					Sometimes it can be really hard to predefine the functionality or purpose of an item.
					To make your life easier start with a 'working title' and update it throughout the development process.

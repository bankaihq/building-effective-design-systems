						# Naming things
						</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					Hi,

					my name is __Sanne Peters__

					I am a __front-end architect__ at __BANKAI__
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					In my work I deal with:
	
					- Design Systems
					- UI components
					- The semantic web
					- Data visualisation
					- Design Op(eration)s
	
					which all involve **naming things**.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					1. Why I care and you should too.
					2. Some theory
					3. Practical tips!

					Notes:
					In this talk I want to discuss the following things...
					But I wanna start with this quote.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					> There are only two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation and naming things.
					>
					> — Phil Karlton

					Notes:
					I bet most of us have heard of this saying. And I like it,
					because points out how deceptively tricky this subject is.

					And since I have no clue how to invalidate cache...
					I picked the other hardest thing to talk about!

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					# Why I care and you should too.

					Notes:
					I have Autism, which means I have difficulty understanding anything implied or hinted at, but I also makes me acutely aware of these problems when they arise. 

					This is why in communication I appreciate clarity and honesty above all else, because that way I will always understand what the other means.

					And I mean communication in the broadest sense of the word. As in documentation, code, conversations).

					This is why I care so much about naming things. Using the right names for something makes communication accessible, for everyone, despite the 'disabilities'. So when you put just that little bit of extra effort into properly naming something, your not just showing you care about the quality of the code, but also about including others.

					# Theory
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Why is naming things hard?</h2>

					<p class="fragment" data-frament-index="1">
						People are lazy. And that is a good thing.
					</p>

					<p class="fragment" data-frament-index="2">
						But this is short term thinking.
					</p>
					<p class="fragment" data-frament-index="2">
						You build <strong>complex systems</strong>,
						that will <strong>grow</strong>, <strong>shrink</strong>,
						<strong>change</strong> over time
					</p>

					<p class="fragment" data-frament-index="3">
						So you need to <strong>think ahead</strong>.
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
					People are lazy. And that is a good thing (most of the time), because they are focused on getting things done. Here and now.

					But this is short term thinking. 
					You are build complex systems,
					that will exist,
					grow AND shrink, 
					change
					over at least a couple of years...

					So you need to think ahead.

					### Semantics,
					### or the philosophy of meaning
					
					Semantics talks about how things do not exist on their own, but always in a context.

					Notes: 
					This context is like a domain, and within a domain you always have a shared language. 
					Like a nation's culture, or a certain industry or a field of science.
					Within each of those domains new concepts are born each day, and each time those concepts need a name.
					</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Shared language

					Names allow us to discuss a subject without it being present.

					Notes:
					Names allow us to discuss a subject without it being present. Like if you want to talk about John from accounting an how he is is really into bonsai. Try doing this without the use of names AND examples!

This is also true if you are building systems. Those systems will inherently contain new components, th need meaningful names. So they can be used effectively in communication. 

It is good to give it a name that makes sense to everyone on the team and maybe even in the organisation. This is what shared language is.

					## Defining names

					Take for instance me. my name is (Sanne), which is a terrible way to identify or describe me. Better ones would be:

					software-architect-at-bankai (In a work context)

					the-tall-know-it-all (In a family context)

					# Practical Tips

					- Reason from another's perspective, not your own.
					- Avoid colloquialisms (Typically local ways of saying things)
					- Use simple words
					- Stay away from abbreviations.
					- Make a name longer vs shorter.

					Notes:
					- Reason from another's perspective, not your own.
					- Avoid colloquialisms
					(Typically local ways of saying things). For example, native English speaker's vocabulary is naturally al lot bigger than non-native ones. So they might know that one specific term for something, but those might very well be completely unknown to others.
					- Use simple words,
					- Stay away from abbreviations.
					They make perfect sense to you, but need to be learned. Especially abbreviations that are not part of common language like 'idx', and 'EOB'.
					- Make a name longer vs shorter.
					Longer names, although verbose, tend to be more descriptive.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Naming things is a creative effort,
					so find some inspiration.

					- In a **thesaurus** (like [thesaurus.com/](https://www.thesaurus.com/))
					- In the field of **semantics** (like [schema.org](http://schema.org))
					- Ask a co-worker or a friend. And brainstorm a little. Two minds are more than one.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Iterate on a name.

					Notes:
					(nice little diagram on why iteration in creative process is useful)
					Sometimes it can be really hard to predefine the functionality or purpose of an item.
					To make your life easier start with a 'working title' and update it throughout the development process.
